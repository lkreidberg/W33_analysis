11/03/2017:
downloaded data
remember to delete files.pic from config directory to read in new files!

11/06/2017:
fixed wavelength shift (first exposure was staring mode to get right buffer dumps)
working on getting scatter down - made window bigger. much better!


11/07/2017:
looked at spectroscopic lightcurves -- something is wrong with the binning


05.30.2018
refactoring fitting code completely

6.15.2018
FOUND ECLIPSE IN WHITE LIGHT CURVE HOOORAY. good baseline, depth ~ 7e-4

06.18.2018
copied over extract.py from HIP41378 analysis, which corrected wavelength problem
    (I think there was a postarg issue)

changing window size:
    06_18_12_23
    window = 100
    rms obs, exp = 163, 23

    06_18_12_28
    window = 120
    rms obs, exp = 163, 23
    

    06_18_12_35
    window = 140
    rms obs, exp = 167, 23

spectroscopic light curves (window = 100, 06_18_12_23)

they look pretty good with divide white! 
    
tried bigger window (300 pix) to see if rms goes down ... NOPE
BUT : the divide_white model has a big offset (300 ppm) in eclipse depth
     

corrected error in the spectroscopic lc predicted rms
(needed to include oversample_factor in estimate of error from
    bin_spectroscopic.py because the error is a *weighted average*
    -- shouldn't just be sqrt(N))

--------
binned closer to native resolution of the spectrograph (~2 pix) ; 50 bins
weird emission features that coincide with the star
tried decorrelating against spectral position (as Haynes+ did): no improvement
got analytic model working for least-squares fit to spectroscopic lc
the analytic fit -> much closer to a blackbody over the full wavelength range
the divide white model has weird "features" towards the blue
used spectra from larger extraction box to see if it improves spec_lc precision
    noteable difference in fit chisq when using larger aperture 
     (06_18_12_35, window = 140)
    better by 2x for redder wavelengths, worse at bluer wavelengths

08/24/18
-------
reduced data with window = 200 pix

TODO:
change extraction box size and stop removed background
GP?
ackbar?
run MCMC


check how much the background counts contribute to eclipse depth dilution
    (Haynes says it's ~100 ppm)

check whether you're double counting leap seconds
