downloaded data
remember to delete files.pic from config directory to read in new files!

11/06/2017:
fixed wavelength shift (first exposure was staring mode to get right buffer dumps)
working on getting scatter down - made window bigger. much better!


11/07/2017:
looked at spectroscopic lightcurves -- something is wrong with the binning


05.30.2018
refactoring fitting code completely

6.15.2018
FOUND ECLIPSE IN WHITE LIGHT CURVE HOOORAY. good baseline, depth ~ 7e-4


TODO:
fix wavelength solution in extraction 
try even bigger window?
fix times: report mid-exposure time and check whether you're double counting leap seconds
