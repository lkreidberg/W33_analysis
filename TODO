combine obs_par and fit_par? maybe use a dictionary? -- get rid of obs_par

make a file that stores what is in each column in the raw data (or add headers)

add from __future__ import print_function, division where necessary
generally, make compatible with python 3

switch to scipy.optimize.curve_fit (can accomodate bounds but not tied parameters)

fix calculation of dof to just include the models you're fitting

redo parse_skip_orbs

change "visit" to "event"

fix print statements and mcmc

set step size in config file (to fix problem with t0)

change output of extract.py and bin_spectroscopic_lc.py 

DONE:
figure out if you need to store data in Model (NO)
separate least square fitting from run.py
add Functions class
make separate files for each model (like in POET)
