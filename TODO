combine obs_par and fit_par? maybe use a dictionary? -- get rid of obs_par
make a file that stores what is in each column in the raw data (or add headers)
make separate files for each model (like in POET)
add from __future__ import print_function, division where necessary
generally, make compatible with python 3
switch to scipy.optimize.curve_fit (can accomodate bounds but not tied parameters)
fix calculation of dof to just include the models you're fitting
