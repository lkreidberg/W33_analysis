fixing sinusoid periods on vonEssen values

get better results with higher cRates value

 --> white light rms = 132 ppm (cRates = 290)


higher cRates gives reasonable fits
also get good fits for varying cRates with actual count rate


emission spectrum levels off at redder wavelengths? fit_2018_10_22_16:07.txt
(but some fits aren't great)

adding three-component sinusoid (with variable periods)

11/3/18:
got three-component sinusoid (with variable periods) working
(fixed cRates on 250 for white lc fit)

white light:
essen periods; free ackbar, crates = 250:  rms = 131 ppm
essen periods; free ackbar, crates = 290:  rms = 135 ppm, BIC 3312.88
free periods; free ackbar, crates = 290:  rms = 123 ppm, BIC 2895.82
    reduce number of sines to 2: rms = 173, BIC 4503.08479023
add fourth sine? BIC is worse, lots of trouble finding best fit


11/4/18:
spec_lc : doesn't improve reduced chi-square to vary sine curve amplitude
    fit didn't usually converge if all sine parameters are free
    very different results for cRates constant versus free 

mcmc for white light curve:
    for 3 sines, a1 and a2 are super degenerate
    for 2 sines, trap_pop_f is unconstrained


11/19/18:
big MCMC for white light curve
three sinusoids, ackbar, cRates = 290
myfuncs = ['constant', 'upstream_downstream', 'polynomial1',  'ackbar', 'eclipse', 'sine2'] 
using extracted_lc/08_25_12_53/lc_white.txt


TODO:
    fix amplitudes/periods for spectroscopic lc?
    fix ackbar parameters for spec lc?         
    are you getting weird results from letting cRates vary as f(lambda)?

    white light mcmc
    spec light mcmc

    same for G141
